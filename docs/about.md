Hello! My name is Hannupekka Sormunen, also known as sorhanp, and this is my blog. I’m writing about my journey to (re)discover joys of programming and software development. I have some experience from my past, mostly from school projects, but I have never been able to launch my career in, let say software company for example, with these skills. After almost seven years without really been in touch with programming, I decided that I must “go back to my roots” and start new career path for myself. My intention is to write reports about what I have learned, what kind of learning materials I have used and what I felt during the process. I try to keep steady updates coming in an almost daily basis. Some of the stuff I link in to, might be in Finnish, but I will leave a warning if that is the case. Basically I use this blog as my learning diary.

At start of this blog I’m in my very early thirties and I hope that this blog can inspire other people of my age to start doing something completely different from their previous career path, after all [you are never too old to become developer][toolate]. So go ahead and pursue your dreams!  Below are my email and links to my LinkedIn and Github pages. Feel free to contact me about anything.

I have used [Jekyll][jekyll] to create this blog. This blog uses the base Jekyll theme called Minima. You can find the source code for Minima at [minima] GitHub
