# The Particle Fire Simulation
This is the home page for the Particle Fire Simulation revision using SDL-library, demonstrating color pixel access and box blur algorithm. This program is part of the [C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners][cppbeginners] course by [John Purcell][johnpurcell].

This version of the program is modified so that it performs more efficiently and the code itself is commented and stylized using [Google C++ Style Guide][googleC++] as much as possible to make the code bit more readable to users. Please see the changes done to the original code and documentation in the [Project's wiki-page][wiki].
