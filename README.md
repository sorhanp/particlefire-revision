# The Particle Fire Simulation Revision

This is the [home page][home] for the Particle Fire Simulation revision using [SDL-library][sdl] and written in C++ -programming language, demonstrating [color pixel access][particle_color] and [box blur algorithm][boxblur]. This program is part of the [C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners][cppbeginners] course by [John Purcell][johnpurcell]. To read about other topics of the same course, please see entries on this [blog][blog], which is used to document the learning progress.

This version of the program is modified so that it [performs more efficiently][performance_overview] and the code itself is commented and stylized using [Google C++ Style Guide][googleC++] as much as possible to make the code bit more readable to users. Please see the changes done to the original code and documentation in the [Project's wiki-page][wiki]. Wiki also has some sample screenshots of the program.
