# The Particle Fire Simulation Revision

This is the wiki for the [Particle Fire Simulation revision][repo] using [SDL-library][sdl] and written in C++, demonstrating color pixel access and box blur algorithm. This program is part of the [C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners][cppbeginners] course by [John Purcell][johnpurcell]. I have also kept [blog][blog] about my learning progress. This version of the program is modified so that it performs more efficiently and the code itself is commented and stylized using [Google C++ Style Guide][googleC++] as much as possible to make the code bit more readable to users.

This wiki is used to document the whole program as completely as possible. Please contact me if you need information about specific parts of the program. The code and this wiki are made available as GNU GPLv3 see [License][license] for more information. Feel free to use, modify and distribute as long as it is at terms of the license. This documentation aims to provide essential learning tools to **box blurring** technique used in the program as well as how different parts of **pixels access** work on SDL.

Finally there is a whole wiki entry about how the [program was made perform faster][performance_overview] than what was programmed at the course initially.
